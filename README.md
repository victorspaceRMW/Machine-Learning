# Machine-Learning
For this project, I collected the machine learning program that I write with Python, R and MATLAB(Maybe more languages in the future). 

Generally that is for personal reference. But you may take them as reference as all the code I uploaded here could run very well on my 
computer(With Python 3.6-Annaconda_Spyder), Rstudio and GNU Octave.
