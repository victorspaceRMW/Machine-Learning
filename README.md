# Machine-Learning Everyday Practice
For this project, I collected all the machine learning programs that I write with Python, R and MATLAB. 

There are machine learning examples as well as summary for the projects.

For Python I used Anaconda-Spyder(Python 3.6) on windows 10. 

You could view the final results in the package DataAnalysisReport:
